    text: "APIClarity, an open-source cloud-native visibility tool for APIs, utilizes a Service Mesh framework to capture and analyze API traffic, and identify potential risks. Use APIClarity to compare your OpenAPI specification to its state at runtime. For apps that donâ€™t have an OpenAPI specification, leverage APIClarity to reconstruct a specification in a live environment. Cloud-native applications use and expose APIs, which have been the source of many highly publicized cyber-attacks and breaches. Leverage APIClarity to improve your API visibility and your application's security posture.",
